# Security Policy

FirmwareDroid is mainly a research project and not a finished product. Therefore it has some known security problems due to the lack of ressources we have-- sorry for that. Nevertheless, we welcome any reports on vulnerabilites and bugs. 

## Supported Versions

Since we are a research project we apply security patches only for the latest version (master-branch) and not for older versions. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can either create a GitHub issue for reporting any security bugs or via email (thomas (dot) sutter1 (at) zhaw (dot) ch).




Thanks for your support! I really appreciate it.
