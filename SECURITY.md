# Security Policy
Welcome to the Security Policy for FirmwareDroid.

FirmwareDroid, primarily a research endeavor rather than a finalized product, acknowledges the existence of certain security vulnerabilities attributable to resource constraints. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Nonetheless, we earnestly encourage the reporting of vulnerabilities and bugs to enhance the project's integrity and security.

### Supported Versions
Given our research-oriented nature, we prioritize the application of security patches exclusively to the latest version (master-branch) and do not extend support to older iterations.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
To report security bugs, kindly utilize one of the following channels:

GitHub: Create a new issue detailing the security concern.
Email: Reach out via (suth at zhaw dot ch)
Your cooperation is invaluable to us. Thank you for your support and understanding.
