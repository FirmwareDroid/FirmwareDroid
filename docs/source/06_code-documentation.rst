API & Code Documentation
========================

This part of the documentation is auto-generated from the source code. The documentation is split into the three main
parts of the code base: REST API, Python code, and the database model based on Mongoengine.

Important Project Folders:
 * api: Contains all the files for the REST API including the routes available for Swagger.io.
 * scripts: This folder contains the main part of the python source code.
 * models: Within this folder reside all the Mongoengine database models.
